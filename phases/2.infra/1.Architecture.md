## 1. Architecture

![Music AI Architecture](./MusicAIArchitecture.jpg)

### Technology Stack
- Frontend:
  - [OpenWebUI](https://docs.openwebui.com/)
- Backend:
  - [OLLaMa](https://ollama.com/)
- Database:
  - Postgres database embedded with OpenWebUI
- Infrastructure:
  - AWS Cloud
    - VPC
    - 2 Subnets, public and private
    - Elastic IP
    - EC2
    - ECS Fargate, 2 containers
      - OpenWebUI
      - Postgres
    - ALB
    - Route53 Domain name
    - Google drive, pre-existing

### Cost estimates:
There will have to be assumptions made within this section to achieve cost estimates.

#### Assumptions
- Complete shutdown and removal of all deployed components, but some resources will need to remain active/reserved
- Cheapest GPU enhanced EC2 will be sufficient for our purposes.  I will not know if it is sufficient until I have it working and responding on it.

#### Resources used and prices

|Resource|Price|Cost per Month 24x30|Cost for 2 hours/month|
|----|----|----|----|
|vpc| free|
|inbound traffic|free|
|outbound traffic |100G free, then .09G after, tiers down|
|2 subnets|free|
|multiple SGs|free|
|2 Fargate containers (2048M RAM, 2 vcpu)|0.04048/hr vCPU, 0.004445/hr Gb RAM|64.69|.18|
|1 EC2, g4ad.xlarge| .37/hr|266.40|.74|
|1 elastic IP|.005/hr|3.60|3.60|
|ecs_cluster|free|
|ecs_task_def|free|
|ecs_service|free|
|efs|.30/Gb/Month|.30|.30|
|alb|variable, avg around .03/hr|21.60|.06|
||Total|352.99|4.88|

Based on these estimates, the importance of tearing down/tearing up the application becomes obvious.
