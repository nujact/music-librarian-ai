# Phase Infrastructure

## 2. Infrastructure as Code

### Terraform

Forked a terraform repo that deploys the latest Ollama AI platform and the OpenWebUI to Fargate.

[Terraform for Ollama & OpenWebUI](https://github.com/nujact/terraform-aws-self-host-llm)

#### Overview of Steps:
1. install terraform and put it into your path locally.  I downloaded the exe, unpacked it, and put into ~/bin, which was already in my path - but the directory did not exist.
2. Modify `sample.auto.tfvars` to contain correct values.  Since I am new to Terraform, I am still working thru these details
3. Run command `terraform init`
4. Run command `terraform apply`

#### `sample.auto.tfvars` review
- Region will need to be updated, references to asia pacific regions
- AZs needs to be updated to us-east
- subnet cidrs should be fine
- better names for subnet names, too generic
- ec2 configs are too big probably, g5g are 2 generation old - g6 and g6e now exist.  Pricing - a review of the smaller GPU enabled EC2s with 4 core and 16 Gigs RAM show that g4ad.xlarge is the cheapest at $0.37 per hour.
- only one ec2 needed with one LLM model running
- API gateway not needed, no API access needed outside of subnet, so SG security is sufficient
- Fargate web container set to 1024M RAM, 512 vcpu.  These can probably be set lower.  I will need to research lower limits.

#### `vpc.tf` review
- ACLs used with rules, which is fine, but I would rather use SGs with rules for easier management and review
- SGs used with no rules, see above note
- flow logs are enable - good.  365 day retention.  Research needed to ensure this is still on the free layer, and not paid for this length of keeping logs.
- SGs do receive rules, focused on ports allowed, not IPs.  Not a bad idea to separate the rules this way.
- public subnet SG is allowing all traffic out on all ports to all IPs.  This must be restricted down, no need for this much outbound permissions
